# contact-manager

My C# project is a contact manager application that creates a list of contacts by allowing contacts to be added or removed and can display all contacts added or give the user the option to exit the program; the list clears when the program is exited.

# Basic Requirements

*Create at least one class:
 *I created a Contact class to satisfy this requirement

*Create at least one object:
 *I created a Contact object to satisfy this requirement 

(Using and displaying the data in the application)

*Create and call at least three functions (one must return a value in the application):
 * add contact
 * remove contact
 * display all contacts
 * may need to add one more that returns a value 

# Feature Requirements

* Implements a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
* Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure (such as a list or array) or file
* Create a list
* Visual representation of data

# Special Instructions

* This program is case sensitive. When selecting a task to run, make sure to use all lowercase letters for your selection.
